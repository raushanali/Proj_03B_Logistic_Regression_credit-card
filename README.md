# Proj_03B_Logistic_Regression_credit-card

This project is based on credit card fraud detection. It uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to identify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset contains transactions by European cardholders over two days, with 492 fraud cases out of a total of 284,807 transactions.

Purpose of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:

To detect fraud in credit card transactions.

To achieve accurate results using machine learning (Logistic Regression).

To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using the confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Data is scaled using Standard Scaler.

Model Training: Logistic Regression algorithm is used.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluated using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score.

Visualization: Graphical display of the Confusion Matrix.

Installation and Usage Instructions
Install Required Libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Download the Dataset:

Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Run the Code:

Save the provided code in the same directory as creditcard.csv and execute it.

Output:

The confusion matrix and accuracy score will be printed.

A graphical display of the confusion matrix will also appear.
